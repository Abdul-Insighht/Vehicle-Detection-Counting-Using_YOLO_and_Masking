# Object Detection

🚗 Vehicle Detection & Counting Using YOLO and Masking

I built a project that can detect, track, and count vehicles in a video, focusing only on a specific area using a mask.

## create a folder in system

    objec_detection

### terminal

    bash setup.sh

### Create a fresh environment

    conda create -n ob_detect python=3.11  
    conda activate ob_detect 
    conda deactivate 

### Install PyTorch first

    pip install torch torchvision torchaudio

### Then install all other requirements

    pip install numpy==2.3.4 pandas opencv-python==4.12.0.88 ultralytics filterpy==1.4.5 scikit-image==0.25.2 lap==0.4.0 yolox

## 🚗 Vehicle Detection & Counting Using YOLO and Masking

"Excited to share my Vehicle Detection & Counting project! 🚗
It detects, tracks, and counts vehicles in a video, focusing only on a specific area using a mask.
Built with YOLOv8 + OpenCV in Google Colab.
This can be useful for traffic monitoring, smart cities, and video analytics.

### Key Features

- Detects vehicles only inside the masked region of the video.

- Tracks each vehicle with unique IDs.

- Counts vehicles crossing a custom counting line.

- Shows live annotated video with bounding boxes and IDs.

- Saves a full output video and a JSON file with counts for further analysis.

- Works efficiently using YOLOv8 and OpenCV in Google Colab.

### Use Cases

- Traffic monitoring

- Parking lot management

- Smart city projects

- Any video analytics requiring focused area detection

### Tech Stack: Python, YOLOv8, OpenCV, Google Colab

Check out the results – full annotated video and count log included! 🔥

A beleave that ,"Small steps, continous learning become a good learner.

Grateful to DSWithBappy, Boktiar Ahmed Bappy and the Inception BD team for their continuous support and guidance.
